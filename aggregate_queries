Cores allocated/cores available

use nova;
select sum(vcpus) from compute_nodes where deleted = 0;

select sum(vcpus) from instances where deleted = 0;

Memory allocated/available

use nova;
select sum(memory_mb)/1024 from compute_nodes where deleted = 0;

select sum(memory_mb)/1024 from instances where deleted = 0;

Storage (on disk, not in ceph)

use nova;
select sum(ephemeral_gb), sum(root_gb) from instances where deleted = 0;

select sum(local_gb) from compute_nodes where deleted = 0;

Ceph storage

use cinder;
select sum(size) from volumes where deleted = 0;

Also see cinder quota-show and quota-usage

Per-tenant usage . . .

use nova;
select project_id, count(*), sum(vcpus), sum(memory_mb)/1024, sum(ephemeral_gb+root_gb) from instances where deleted = 0 group by project_id order by count(*) desc;

This then needs to be linked to the keystone DB.

use cinder;
select project_id, count(*), sum(size) from volumes where deleted = 0 group by project_id order by count(*) desc;

Instance creation rates:

use nova;
select project_id, count(*) from instances where created_at > date("2015-04-01") and deleted_at < date("2015-05-01") group by project_id order by count(*) desc;

Mapping between tenant ids and project names/info:

keystone tenant-get <id>

Linking with mancini to get additional information would be nice, but isn't 
going to happen real soon.
